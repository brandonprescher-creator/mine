## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### How to Build Each Feature

**1. Create Activity Module**
```python
# Example: instructional_tools/math/equation_solver.py

from ..base.activity_base import MathActivity

class EquationSolverActivity(MathActivity):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.steps = self.config.get('steps', [])
    
    def generate_hints(self, current_step=0):
        # Progressive hint logic
        pass
    
    def check_step(self, step_number, student_answer):
        # Validation logic
        pass
```

**2. Create Template**
```html
<!-- templates/activities/equation_solver.html -->
{% extends "base.html" %}
<!-- Interactive UI for the activity -->
```

**3. Add Route**
```python
# app_updated.py or blueprints/activities.py

@app.route('/activity/equation-solver/<int:activity_id>')
def equation_solver(activity_id):
    # Load activity, render template
    pass
```

**4. Create Submission Handler**
```python
@app.route('/api/submit/equation-solver', methods=['POST'])
def submit_equation_solver():
    # Process student work, save to DB
    pass
```

## üí° DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

**This isn't just homework software.**

It's a **cognitive apprenticeship system** where:
- Teachers model expert thinking
- Students practice with support
- Feedback is immediate and specific
- Learning is visible through work
- Mastery builds over time

**Every feature asks:**
1. Does this help students understand?
2. Can students show their thinking?
3. Will teachers use this?
4. Is the feedback meaningful?
5. Does it integrate with curriculum?

## üìû NEXT STEPS

**Immediate Actions:**

1. ‚úÖ **Foundation Complete** - Infrastructure ready
2. üéØ **Build Phase 1** - 5 quick-win features
3. üìù **Create Templates** - UI for each tool
4. üß™ **Pilot Test** - Try with real users
5. üîÑ **Iterate** - Improve based on feedback

**Want to contribute?**

Pick a feature from the list, implement it following the patterns in `instructional_tools/base/`, create templates, test it, and submit a PR!
